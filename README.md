My current personal website, initially created in December 2018, and finished in June 2019.

About this Website
---
This project was mainly a challenge for myself to design a website completely from scratch. I didn't know how to write code in Javascript, or what a PHP even was (I still don't), but I was determined to figure out how to build my own website from the bottom up. It uses PHP, Javascript, and CSS, painstakingly written mostly by myself.

Some packages I used in this project include [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/), [Lightcase](https://cornel.bopp-art.com/lightcase/), and [Photoswipe](https://photoswipe.com/).

If you want to know how I felt about making this whole project, watch my YouTube video documenting the process [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9kFJgJnLXA&t=8s).
